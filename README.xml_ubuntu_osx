XML problems
------------

To compile PETeR, the expat XML libraries and header files are
needed. These are not present on a standard Ubuntu or OS X installation.

For Ubuntu, "expat" and "expat dev" should be installed.

For OS X, the library can be downloaded from sourceforge. A standard
"configure", "make" and "make install" should be enough.
